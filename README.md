## Linked List Implementation in C

This project is a university assignment implemented in the C programming
language. It demonstrates a basic linked list data structure with a modular
design using header and source files.

### The project includes:
- Linked list implementation (`list.c`, `list.h`)
- Main program demonstrating usage (`main.c`)
- Test file for functionality checking (`test.c`)
- Makefile for building the project
- Coding style guidelines

### Key concepts demonstrated:
- Dynamic memory management
- Pointers and structures
- Modular C programming
- Separation of interface and implementation
- Basic build automation with Makefile

Written in C as part of university coursework.
